1. The toughest part of this piece of the assignment was deciding how to go about measuring variability in procedures and then wrangling the data to create the desired table.
The actual results were achieved through a single one-liner SQL query.  I started the analysis by deciding to assess procedural variability by using the procedures as described in
the Timely and Effective Care table.  This table listed 22 distinct procedures which were scored by the Hospital Compare study.  In order to assess procedural variability 
between hospitals I would have to calculate the standard deviation of the scores grouped by procedure (formally named as measure_id). 

2. An initial review of the data revealed that almost half the values for the "score" measure were listed as "Not Available" and another 4,000+ values were coded as NULL values.
Therefore, the first step I took was filtering all NA and NULL values from the final table.  Once cleaned I ran a simple stddev function across all scores grouped by the measure_id.
The final results showed that the procedure with the greatest (absolute) variability between hospitals was the amount of time a patient spent waiting in the ER prior to being 
admitted as an inpatient at the hospital.
