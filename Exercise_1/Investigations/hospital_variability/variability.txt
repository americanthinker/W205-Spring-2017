1. The toughest part of this piece of the assignment was deciding how to go about measuring variability in procedures and then wrangling the data to create the desired table.
The actual results were achieved through a single one-liner SQL query.  I started the analysis by deciding to assess procedural variability by using the procedures as described in
the Timely and Effective Care table.  This table listed 22 distinct procedures which were scored by the Hospital Compare study.  In order to assess procedural variability 
between hospitals I had to calculate the standard deviation of the scores grouped by procedure (formally named as measure_id).  Furthermore, because the measure scores were
not in the same units of measurement, I chose to focus on those procedures which measured time in minutes as a way of assessing quantifiable differences between hospitals.
There is no doubt a way to normalize column values using SQL and take variance statistics from those normalized scores, but given the time I had available to me and my current
state of SQL skills, I had to settle for an incomplete answer. 

2. An initial review of the data revealed that almost half the values for the "score" measure were listed as "Not Available" and another 4,000+ values were coded as NULL values.
Therefore, the first step I took was filtering all NA and NULL values from the final table.  Next step was filtering out all entities that were not US states (in keeping with
standard practice from previous query).  Finally, I filterd out all procedures which were not measured in unit of time (specifically minutes) to ensure I got an apples to apples
comparison when reviewing variance in procedurs. 

3. Once cleaned I ran a simple stddev function across all scores grouped by the measure_id.  The final results showed that the procedure with the greatest (absolute) variability
between hospitals was the amount of time a patient spent waiting in the ER prior to being admitted as an inpatient at the hospital.  Waiting times ranged from close to 17 hours
to 1 hour, with an average of around 4 hours prior to admission.  The procedure with the least variability among hospitals was the median number of minutes before a patient
who presented with chest pain or possible heart attack received an echocardiogram (ECG).  Scores ranged from 56 minutes to 0 minutes with an average of 8 minutes.  This finding
is not surprising given the modern standardized protocol of ensuring all patients presenting with chest pain are quickly triaged for potential heart attack.
