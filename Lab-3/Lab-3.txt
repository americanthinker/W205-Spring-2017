1. List the execution time of the weblog aggregation query for Hive, SparkSQL, and SparkSQL on Parquet.
Hive: 40.771 sec
SparkSQL: 4.776 sec (a blazing 90% reduction in processing time)
SparkSQL on Parquet: 1.222 sec (a further 75% reudction)

2. How many jobs does Hive launch? Does SparkSQL launch jobs?
To process the query Hive launched two (2) MR jobs.
The CLI does not explicitly state that Spark SQL launched jobs, however one can assume
that since the query was processed at least one job was launched. It's my understanding 
that both platforms use the MapReduce framework, but Spark is quicker because of the way it processes data in-memory as compared to Hive which stores data on disk.

3. List the top 5 locations from SQL query joining weblogs_parquet and user_info:
Hamilton 	19
Axis	 	18
Hazel Green	17
La Fayette 	17
Headland	17
