1. There are 5377 rows with missing values in the State column.  This was easy to find
because there was a “blank” label/selection at the bottom of the list of states.  

2. We’ve got 4,362 rows that are missing ZIP code values.

3. If all ZIP codes less than 99999 are considered as valid then we have 380,136 of them. 
The only invalid ones are those cells which are blank, of which we have 4,361.

4. Changing the radius to 3.0 expands the clustering mechanism to include other similarly 
labeled locations.  I found a happy medium at radius 3.0 and Block Characters 4.0.  Those
parameters hit a good cross between including similarly spelled words, without going 
overboard.

5. I ended up merging variations on Alaska, California, and Canada.

6. See attached picture of Levenshtein distance calculation completed in Excel.  Attached 
PythonLevenshtein.png also confirms the correct answer using the Levenshtein module in Python.
